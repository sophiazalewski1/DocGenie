            "Question: What does the ChangeDatabase method do?\n",
            "Answer: The ChangeDatabase method allows users to change the database being used by the connection. It requires the connection to be closed because the database change cannot be made while the connection is open. The connection must be returned to the pool after this method is called.\n",
            "Question: What is the purpose of the Close method?\n",
            "Answer: The Close method is used to close the connection and releases any allocated resources. The transaction associated with the connection is rolled back until it is restarted later. The connection is also placed back into the connection pool for reuse.\n",
            "Question: What is the CreateCommand method?\n",
            "Answer: The CreateCommand method creates an IngresCommand object. This object can then be used to execute SQL queries and other database operations on the Actian database.\n",
            "Question: What does the Dispose method do?\n",
            "Answer: The Dispose method is used to release the resources held by a connection after it is closed. It is also a way to signal the connection to be closed when it is no longer needed.\n",
            "Question: What is the purpose of the EnlistDistributedTransaction method?\n",
            "Answer: The EnlistDistributedTransaction method allows a connection to be enlisted in an existing distributed transaction. This method is mutually exclusive with the BeginTransaction method.\n",
            "Question: What is the purpose of the EnlistTransaction method?\n",
            "Answer: The EnlistTransaction method allows for the IngresConnection object to be enlisted in an existing transaction, either an ITransaction or a System.Transactions.Transaction object. This method is mutually exclusive with the BeginTransaction method.\n",

            "Question: When should the ChangeDatabase method be used for the IngresConnection class?\n",
            "Answer: The ChangeDatabase method for the IngresConnection class should be used when the database being used for the connection needs to be changed. This method must be called before the Close method to prevent an error.\n",
            "Question: What does the Close method do for the IngresConnection class?\n",
            "Answer: The Close method for the IngresConnection class closes the connection and releases allocated resources. It also has a rollback pending transaction which means that any transaction started during the life of the connection will not be committed until this method is called.\n",

            "Question: What does the Dispose method do for the IngresConnection class?\n",
            "Answer: The Dispose method for the IngresConnection class releases resources used by the class and closes the connection, and also the Disposed event will be set to true.\n",
