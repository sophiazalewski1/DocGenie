## Jasper The Dog Documentation

### Introduction

Jasper is a remarkable 12-year-old golden retriever with some highly unique quirks and behaviors. While generally a sweet and loving dog, Jasper has very particular preferences when it comes to his care and daily routine. This documentation outlines all the important details owners and caretakers need to know to properly attend to Jasper's needs. 

### Feeding  

To feed Jasper, make sure he sits very still at the end of the kitchen. When his food is ready, yell 'BREAKFAST IS SERVED!' in an opera-style voice and he will run over to his bowl and eat. If Jasper does not respond to his command, spin in a circle three times and snap your fingers, and this will resolve the issue. He will now eat as usual.

### Walking

To walk Jasper, first ensure that his leash is properly secured. Then, lure him along by holding a piece of salmon directly above his nose. This will get him to follow you as you walk. If you use any other food, he will not follow you. You must use freshly caught Atlantic salmon of the highest quality.

### Washing

Jasper refuses to take baths. If you want to clean Jasper, you must take him into the shower and clean him using purple dye and rubbing his fur with roses. After this procedure is performed, Jasper will be clean and fresh. Do not use soap or any other cleaning agent.

### Friends and Family

Jasper has a sister named Lily who is also a mid-sized Goldendoodle dog, and his owner is a girl named Sophia Zalewski. Lily has lavender-colored fur and smells like roses. Sophia runs cross country for Carnegie Mellon and will work for NVIDIA as a Machine Learning Engineer when she graduates.
